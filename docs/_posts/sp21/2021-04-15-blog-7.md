# Setting up a Remote Selenium WebDriver

**Selenium** is a collection of open source APIs which are used to automate the testing of a web appllication.

In my previous **blog 0.6**, I have demonstrated the testing using Selenium WebDriver locally. In this blog, I will demonstrate the options to use
Selenium WebDriver **REMOTELY**. Yes, Remotely. We can use WebDriver remotely the same way you would use it **locally.**

**Difference:** The primary difference is that a **remote** WebDriver needs to be configured so that it can run our tests on a seperate machine.

A remote WebDriver is composed of two pieces: a **client** and a **server.** The client is your WebDriver test and the server is simply a JAVA servlet, which
can be hosted in any modern JEE app server.

# Creating a WEB SERVER using AWS EC2 (docker-compose)

We can create a EC2 instance with **docker-compose** AMI (Amazon Machine Image). By selecting the AMI with docker-compose we will have all the required software
and java environment variables which is required to run the **tests**.

For this particular testing we will configure the Security Groups:
> SSH TCP from anywhere
> Custom TCP port 4444 from anywhere

# Configuring the EC2 Webserver

By hosting this web-server we can use **ipv4 address** and **port number** in our Selelnium Source Code to run tests remotely.
Before we can use this web-server, we need to configure the environment settings inside the web-server by accessing using **ssh**.

To access the newly created EC2 instance: 
> sudo ssh -i <keypair> ec2-user@<ipv4addr>

Steps to configure:

* sudo yum update
* check the java version and remove/update accordingly
* check if the docker is installed in this machine

# Creating a Customer Docker file

We need to create a Docker File that can run a **Selenium-HUB**. Here, Selenium-Hub will install different **Images** of different web browsers.
In other words, Selenium-Hub will hold different **Nodes** which runs tests for different types of web-browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Opera, etc.)

We can get different versions of **docker-compose** in yml format from the following github repo:
[docker-compose-github](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/docker-selenium)
