I have created this blog post on how to install Anaconda and the necessary packages required to perform Data Analysis and vizualization.

# Anaconda

Anaconda is a free and open-source distribution of the ***Python*** and ***R*** programming laguages for scientific computing (***data science, machine leaning
applications, large-scale data processing, predicitve analysis***, etc.). This open source distribution aims to provide simplified package management and deployment. 
The distribution includes data-science packages suitable for Windodws, Linux, and macOs. It is developed and maintained by Anaconda, Inc.

# Difference between package installation with 'pip' and 'conda'
 
 Most of the time while installing anaconda packages I use 'conda install <package>' . However, the packages can be installed using either 'pip' or 'conda'. While installing package with 'pip', it automatically installs any dependent Python packages without checking and it could conflict with previously installed packages. It will install a package regardless of the state of the existing installation. 

> EG: google 'Tensorflow', can find that it stops working having used 'pip' to install a different package that requires a different version of the dependent numpy library than the one used by Tensorflow.

In the other hand, using 'conda' to install packages, it will analyse the current environment including everything currently installed, and any versions limitations specified. Since the user may wish to have both Tensorflow version 2.0 or higher and shows warning if this cannot be performed.

# Anaconda Navigator 

There are different applications on the base(root) which can be viewed using Anaconda Navigator:
> **Powershell Prompt**, **JupyterNotebook**, **RStudio**, **Glueviz**, **Spyder**, etc.

We can further download new applications, packages and environment using **Anconda Navigator** or **CONDA prompt**. I prefer using 'CONDA prompt' to install packages

# Jupyter Notebook and packages for data analysis

 Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents. I have been using this open-source web appliation for my project. 
There are different packages required to be installed using Anaconda Prompt to use in the Jupyter Notebook.

Some of the useful and most used packages are listed below:

* conda install -c anaconda numpy
* conda isntall pandas
* conda install -c conda-forge matplotlib
* conda install -c anaconda scikit-learn
* conda install -c anaconda graphviz
 
# Example of using Jupyter Notebook

 I will give a short brief on had a project on medium range data set to make analysis using different tools. The main objective of this project was to  

> import numpy as np

> import pandas as pd

> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


Here, we will use pandas to extract the **CSV** file and create a new DataFrame

> df_wine= pd.read_csv('../wine-labeled.csv')
