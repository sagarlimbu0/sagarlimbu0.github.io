# Amazon EC2 Instance
 An EC2 Instance is a virtual server in Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) for running applications on the 
Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure. It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers.
Amazon EC2's simple web service interface allows us to choose the best optimal configureation for the Amazon Machine
Image (AMI). It further provides with complete control of your computing resources that meets the best requirement
for runing cloud environment

In this blog, I will try to show the steps for Launching a EC2 instance:

> * Aws_ami
> * Selecting Instance Type
> * Security Groups
> * EC2 termination

# AWS Management Console
 The AWS Management Console is the UI for a secure, easy-to-access and web-based portal for navigating different 
AWS Services

# AWS AMI
 An AWS Amazon Machine Image is a template for software configuration which includes OS, applicaton server, and applications
required to launch your instance. There are different AMI you can choose for your running instance. AWS Marketplace also
provides different AMIs. We will select the free-tier AMI for this tutorial.

# Launching and Selecting the Instance Type
 After Launching new Instance we can select diferrent types of Instances based on storage, memory, Network perofrmance,
Type, vCPUs. We can select the free Instance type for the tutorial.

# Selecting the Security Groups
 When launching new AWS AMI instance we also need to specify security groups. A security group acts as a virtual firewall
for you instance to contorl inbound and outbound traffic. We can assign upto five security groups to the instance.
>NOTE: Security groups act at the instance level, not the subnet level whereas Network ACLs are tied to subnet level

# Key Pair
 After selecting the appropriate instance type and configuratoin settings, we have the option to select an existing
key pair or create a new key pair. A key pair consisits of public key that AWS stores, and a private key file that you
store. Together, they allow you to connect your instance securely.

# Checking the EC2 Instance Status
 We can view the status for the existing and new launched EC2 instance on the EC2 Dashboard.
