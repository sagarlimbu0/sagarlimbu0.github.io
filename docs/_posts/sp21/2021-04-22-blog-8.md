# Cloudformation

AWS Cloudformation is a service that gives developers and businesses an easy way to create a collection of related
AWS and third-party resources, and provision manage them in a an orderly and predictable fashion.

Benifitst of using Cloudformation:

* Simplify infrastructure management
* It allows to quickly replicate your infrastructure
* It allows to easily control and track changes to your infrastructure
 
# CloudFormation Template

A cloudformation template requires to be in **JSON** format text file or in **YML** format. In this text file format, you need to
describe your AWS infrastructure. 
Templates can include several major sections:

* AWS TemplateFormatVersion
* Description
* Metadata
* Parameters
* Mappings
* Conditions
* Resources
* Outputs

# DynamoDB Table

In this example, I will demonstrate a cloud formation template to create a AWS DynamoDB table with two attributes: ArtistName, AlbumName
By creating a file on **yml** format we can upload as the stack on the AWS cloudformation service section. 

```
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: "2010-09-09"
Resources: 
  myDynamoDBTable: 
    Type: AWS::DynamoDB::Table
    Properties: 
      AttributeDefinitions: 
        - 
          AttributeName: "ArtistName"
          AttributeType: "S"
        - 
          AttributeName: "AlbumName"
          AttributeType: "S"


      KeySchema: 
        - 
          AttributeName: "ArtistName"
          KeyType: "HASH"
        - 
          AttributeName: "AlbumName"
          KeyType: "RANGE"
      ProvisionedThroughput: 
        ReadCapacityUnits: "5"
        WriteCapacityUnits: "5"
      TableName: "Artist_DB"
```

In the above template, resource type identifies the type of resources that you are declaring. 
Here, you will define the resource as **AWS::DynamoDB::Table** and as well as the **attributes.**
