# Setting up Docker on Windows
As we know Docker is a popular software package that creates a container of application development. Docker uses
Os-level virtualization to install software packages called containers. 

Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their won software, libraries and configuration files.

You can install Docker Toolbox from the following link:
 * [Docker Docs](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/)

To download the latest version of Docker tool box you should select the right release version
with '.exe' file. After downloading the file, just follow the instructions on the setup wizard.
