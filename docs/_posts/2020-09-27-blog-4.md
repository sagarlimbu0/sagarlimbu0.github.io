I have created this blog post on how to install Anaconda and the necessary packages required to perform Data Analysis and vizualization.

# Anaconda

Anaconda is a free and open-source distribution of the ***Python*** and ***R*** programming laguages for scientific computing (***data science, machine leaning
applications, large-scale data processing, predicitve analysis***, etc.). This open source distribution aims to provide simplified package management and deployment. 
The distribution includes data-science packages suitable for Windodws, Linux, and macOs. It is developed and maintained by Anaconda, Inc.

# Difference between package installation with 'pip' and 'conda'
 
 Most of the time while installing anaconda packages I use 'conda install <package>' . However, the packages can be installed using either 'pip' or 'conda'. While installing package with 'pip', it automatically installs any dependent Python packages without checking and it could conflict with previously installed packages. It will install a package regardless of the state of the existing installation. 

> EG: google 'Tensorflow', can find that it stops working having used 'pip' to install a different package that requires a different version of the dependent numpy library than the one used by Tensorflow.

In the other hand, using 'conda' to install packages, it will analyse the current environment including everything currently installed, and any versions limitations specified. Since the user may wish to have both Tensorflow version 2.0 or higher and shows warning if this cannot be performed.
