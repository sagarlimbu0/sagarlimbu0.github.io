# Terraform

**Terraform** is an open-source infrastructure as code software tool created by HashiCorp. The configurations and settings applied on Terraform code allows us to run a single 
application or entire datacenter.  

**Terraform** is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. Terraform can manage existing and popular
service providers as well as custom in-house solutions.

# Using Terrafrom to create AWS EC2 Instance

By using different terraform **tags** we can create and launch new EC2 instance.

Here, we are defining the provider's name and region where the Instance will be created.

```
provider "aws"{
	region = "us-west-2"
}
```

# Creating AWS AMI 

We will use ubuntu as Linux OS distribution for the AWS AMI. We will define the 
aws ami(amazon machine image) with latest version. The reference strings 
is denoted as "ubuntu". 


```
data "aws_ami" "ubuntu"{
	most_recent= true

	filter {
	 name= "name"
	 values= ["ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-focal-20.04-amd64-server-*"]	
	}

	filter{
	 name= "virtualization-type'
	 values= ["hvm"]
	}
	
	owners = ["<id>"]
}

```

# Creating AWS Instance with AMI 

Here, we have defined a AWS EC2 Instance with **resource tag** aws_instance along with **ec2_web** as reference that 
can be called in other resource tags. 

In the **ami** section we have used the reference from the above **data** for AWS AMI which will create new 
**AWS Instance***.

```
resource "aws_instance" "ec_2web"{
	
	ami= data.aws_ami.ubuntu.id
	instance_type = "t3.micro"
	
	tags= {
		Name= "Hello Earth"
	}
}
```

# Defining AWS Policy for S3 Bucket

AWS policies are written in **JSON** format. Thus, we need to write a code that will denote the policies in JSON format.
Here, we will write a small code in JSON format that will provide the policy for AWS S3 bucket usage.

First, we create a S3 Bucket with a **globally-unique** name.
```
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "buck" {
	bucket= "limbu_blog_bucket"
}

```

# Providing Full AWS S3 Access

Now, we will define the policy attached to S3 bucket b providing the S3 bucket name on the bucket section.
We can see the **action** section **allows** to use every **resources** with ***** option attached to **S3** bucket.
   

```
resource "aws_s3_bucket_policy" "buck" {
	bucket= aws_s3_bucket.buck.id
	
	policy = <<EOF
	{
		"Version": "2020-10-17",
		"Statement": [
			{
		 	"Action": [
		   	"s3:*"
			],
			"Effect": "Allow"
			"Resource": "*"
			}
	 		]	
	}
	EOF
 }
}

```
