# AWS S3 Bucket

Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) is an object storage service that offers industry-leading
scalability, data availability, security, and performance. 

S3 Bucket allows to scale your resources up and down to meet fluctuating demands. It is designed
for 99.99999999999% (11 9's) of data durability. Thus, the data are sotred as object aross multiple
systems making it available when needed.

# Creating a S3 Bucket with AWS console

To create a S3 bucket, we need to assign a **globally-unique** name. We also need to assign role and policy 
of **Aamzon S3 Full Acesss** to the user before creating S3 Bucket. This AWS managed policy **AamazonS3FullAccess** policy will allow 
the EC2 to access S3 Resources.

We can launch a new EC2 instance by the desired Linux Os, storage, security groups, and tags.

# Settting the permission on Key Pair

After creating a new EC2 instance, we can download the **key pair**. The key pair file has an extension of **.pem**.
We need to locate the path to key pair and set the permission with **chmod** command.

```
chmod 400 <key pair>
```

However, in my experience I simply used the **key pair** to get access to AWS EC2 instance without any error.


# Accessing the AWS EC2 instance using CLI

After launching the new EC2 isntance we can use **SSH** to gain access to the specific EC2 Instance.
We should determine the path to **key pair** and locate the **Ipv4 Address** of the newly created EC2 instance. 

We also need to verify the **ingress** and **outgress** traffic rules on the security group. 
Here, we will use **ssh** to gain access to the EC2 Instance. 

```
sudo ssh -i <path to key pair> ec2-user@<ipv4 address of EC2 instance>
```

While doing **ssh** to the EC2 instance we need to identify the distribution of Linux OS.
For example:

> ubuntu: ubuntu@<ipv4 address>
> Amazon Linux 2: ec2-user@<ipv4 address>
> Debian: admin@<ipv4 address>
> Centos: centos@<ipv4 address>
 
We need to make sure to allow inbound rule for **SSH** traffic from your desired IP address to your instance.

# Installing AWS CLI

After gaining access to your EC2 Instance, we can install **AWS CLI**.

```
apt-get install awscli
``` 
Now based on the given policy and role, we can perform several **aws** commands on this EC2 instance.

# Creating AWS S3 Bucket

Here, the following command will create a new S3 Bucket on **us-west-1** region.

```
aws s3 mb s3://bucketLimbu --region us-west-1
```

# Different commands to operate on S3 Bucket

* cp - Copy files to S3 bucket

```
aws s3 cp test.txt s3://bucketLimbu/test.txt
```

* ls- List all the S3 buckets

```
aws s3 ls
```
