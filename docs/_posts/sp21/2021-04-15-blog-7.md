# Setting up a Remote Selenium WebDriver

![selenium](/assets/images/spring_21/blog_7/selenium_icon.png)

**Selenium** is a collection of open source APIs which are used to automate the testing of a web appllication.

In my previous **blog 0.6**, I have demonstrated the testing using Selenium WebDriver locally. In this blog, I will demonstrate the options to use
Selenium WebDriver **REMOTELY**. Yes, Remotely. We can use WebDriver remotely the same way you would use it **locally.**

**Difference:** The primary difference is that a **remote** WebDriver needs to be configured so that it can run our tests on a seperate machine.

A remote WebDriver is composed of two pieces: a **client** and a **server.** The client is your WebDriver test and the server is simply a JAVA servlet, which
can be hosted in any modern JEE app server.

# Creating a WEB SERVER using AWS EC2 (docker-compose)

We can create a EC2 instance with **docker-compose** AMI (Amazon Machine Image). By selecting the AMI with docker-compose we will have all the required software
and java environment variables which is required to run the **tests**.

For this particular testing we will configure the Security Groups:
> SSH TCP from anywhere
> Custom TCP port 4444 from anywhere

# Configuring the EC2 Webserver

By hosting this web-server we can use **ipv4 address** and **port number** in our Selelnium Source Code to run tests remotely.
Before we can use this web-server, we need to configure the environment settings inside the web-server by accessing using **ssh**.

To access the newly created EC2 instance: 
> sudo ssh -i <keypair> ec2-user@<ipv4addr>

Steps to configure:

* sudo yum update
* check the java version and remove/update to NEW ver.
* check if the docker is installed

# Creating a Customer Docker file

We need to create a Docker File that can run a **Selenium-HUB**. Here, Selenium-Hub will install different **Images** of different web browsers.
In other words, **Selenium-Hub** will hold different **Nodes** which runs tests for different types of web-browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Opera, etc.)

# SOURCE code for Docker File
We can get different versions of **docker-compose** in yml format from the following github repo:

[docker-compose-github](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/docker-selenium)

# Architecture of Selenium-Hub hosted inside the EC2 WebServer

![selenium_hub](/assets/images/spring_21/blog_7/selenium_hub.png)

In the above diagram, we can see that Selenium-Hub running on EC2 Web-server will be the main target point for our **tests**. 
By pointing our url inside source code with the **ip addr** and **port number,** we can run tests **remotely**.

Example:

Importing the Libraries:
```
# Using selenium to get TRACK info
import selenium
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.options import Options
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys
from selenium.webdriver.common.desired_capabilities import DesiredCapabilities

```
Acutal Source Code that takes **Ipv4 address** and **Port Number** of EC2 web-server that hosts the SELENIUM-HUB.

Steps:

* Create a WebDriver 
* Options: tests without opening web browser. Here, using Firefox
* By using Remote Webdriver the target point for URL is the EC2 Webserver IPV4 address and port number

```
browser_options= Options()
browser_options.add_argument('--headless')

# REMOTE web driver from AWS
# pass the IPV4 address and port number AND dir: /wd/hub    
# remotely testing, using AWS ec2

chrome_options= webdriver.ChromeOptions()
    
# REMOTE web driver via FIREFOX
browser= webdriver.Remote(command_executor="34.220.193.159:4444/wd/hub", options= chrome_options)

# PASS the URL of Wikipedia to search for specific artist
browser.get('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tupac_Shakur')
# wating time before scrapping
browser.implicitly_wait(5)
```

* Test: get element from the specified web page

Here, we can get the paragraph text from the wikipedia.
```
name_artist= browser.find_element_by_xpath('//*[@id="firstHeading"]')
print(name_artist.text)

```
# Background work

Every time the source code runs, the EC2 web-server will get the request on Selenium-Hub. This request will be passed through the **Nodes** to
the desired web-browser that has been assigned on the source code. In the above example, I have tested the web-server with FireFox.
