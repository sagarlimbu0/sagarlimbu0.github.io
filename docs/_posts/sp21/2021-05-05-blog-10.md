# Github Action

![githubAction](/assets/images/spring_21/blog_10/githubAction.png)

In this blog, I will demonstrate some actions with **Github Action** script. Github Action allow us to automate, customize, and execute your software development
workflows right in your repository with GitHub Actions. 

With Github action we can create and share **actions** to perform any job including CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continous Delivery). Furthermore,
we can also completly customized the workflow.
 
# Storing Secrets on Github Repo

We can store our credentials on github repository as **secrets** and use GitHub Action script to run specific jobs.

# Storing Credentials on Github Repo

We need to store credentials insde the github repository. Go to **Settings -> Secrets -> Add New Repository Secret**

# Creating Github Action Script

First, we need to create a directory named **.github/workflows** in the same directory. The directory name **workflows** inside the '.github' should be plural.

File format running the Github Action should be in **yaml** format.
