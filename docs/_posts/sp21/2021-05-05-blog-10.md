# Github Action

![githubAction](/assets/images/spring_21/blog_10/githubAction.png)

In this blog, I will demonstrate some actions with **Github Action** script. Github Action allow us to automate, customize, and execute your software development
workflows right in your repository with GitHub Actions. 

With Github action we can create and share **actions** to perform any job including CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continous Delivery). Furthermore,
we can also completly customized the workflow.
 
# Storing Secrets on Github Repo

We can store our credentials on github repository as **secrets** and use GitHub Action script to run specific jobs.

# Storing Credentials on Github Repo

We need to store credentials insde the github repository. Go to **Settings -> Secrets -> Add New Repository Secret**

# Creating Github Action Script

First, we need to create a directory named **.github/workflows** in the same directory. The directory name **workflows** inside the '.github' should be plural.

The **Script** running the Github Action should be in the **yaml** format.

Following **script** will upload specified file to AWS S3 Bucket everytime when the action git **push** is performed. We can set the action to be different with specified jobs.

```
name: upload_file

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: configure aws credentials
      uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1

      with:
        aws-access-key-id: \${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY }}
        aws-secret-access-key: \${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_KEY }}
        aws-region: us-west-2

    - name: copy files to s3 bucket
      run: |
        aws s3 cp testingFile.txt s3://myTestingBucket/testingFile.txt

```
# Explanation on Script

* In the above script, we have used the latest ubuntu to run our script. 
* Every time whenever the code is pushed into the Github Repository the script will run with the **job**(actions) specified
* By using the **saved** credentials on Github Repository we can get access to AWS S3 Bucket
* Credentials access: **\${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY }} and \${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_KEY }}**
* Filename **testingFile.txt** will be copied into the S3 bucket **myTestingBucket** with name **testingFile.txt**
