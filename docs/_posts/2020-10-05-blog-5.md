# Using MySQL Database
![mysql_cover](/assets/images/blog_5/mysql_cover.png)

MySQL is a popular and open-source relational database application. I recently used MySQL to query some database for
my project. 
I will go step by step to install MySQL on windows and show a short demo using a newly created database. 

# Installing mysql server for windows
![mysql_install](/assets/images/blog_5/mysql_installer.png)

[mysql_installation](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/8.0.html)

You need to follow instructions **based on the requirement of your computer** in order to install MySQL.

> root user and password required

# MySQL database can be connected using either command line or MySQL workbench
For my small project I used MySQL workbench. However, I will show short commmand lines to connect using command prompt as well.

* open a command prompt from windows
* Locate the path where you have installed the MySQL community.
* This is located usually on the C:\programfiles\MysQL\MysQL Server <version>\bin

Run this command to get access to MySQL database. However, I got an error because I noticed that I had **Stopped** the MySQL server before.

```
C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\bin>ls
'ls' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.

```

After starting the MySQL server again and using the same command it works. We need to use the same **root** password assigned prior installation.


```
C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\bin>mysql.exe -u root -p
Enter password: ********
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.

# Accessing MySQL Workbench

In my experience with the project, MySQL workbench is a great alternative of command-line access. The GUI workbench
allows to perform all types of querries, navigate, and check server status.

Navigator section you can select the **Administration** to check server satus, logs, connection, users and privieleges,etc. 
On the **Schemas** section you can view all the database created. 

# Creating new database

You can see several options on the **Menu** bar.
I will select **Create a new schema on the connected server**
> Now, write down the prefered name for this schema. here, I will use 'ex_1' and Click 'Apply'

You can see the newly created schema on the **SCHEMAS** section

# Performing SQL Querries

I will perfrom some of the querries on the existing database.

* Select employees who has worked more than **50 hours**

```
use ex_1;

SELECT DISTINCT a.employeeNumber

```

* Updating the records and phone number by specific **Employee Number**
```
UPDATE employee
SET OfficePhone = '818-531-1670', position='HR'
WHERE employeeNumber =16;
```

We can perform different types of querries on this GUI MySQL workbench. I think it is a great platform 
for the database administrator to use datbase on day to day basis.
